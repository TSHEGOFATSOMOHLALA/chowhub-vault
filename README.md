# CHOWHUB - High-Security Skeuomorphic Vault 🔐
**Submission for Nexmotion Technologies Placement Internship**

## 🎯 The Vision
ChowHub is a theatrical food-ordering prototype designed to push the boundaries of standard web interfaces. Moving away from traditional "calculator-style" inputs, this project utilizes a **Skeuomorphic Circular Dial** and **Glassmorphism** to create an immersive "Security Vault" experience.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Framework:** React 19 (TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (3D Scaling & Circular Rotations)
- **Icons:** Lucide-React
- **State Management:** React Hooks & LocalStorage

## ✨ Premium Features
- **Security-First PIN Masking:** Entry codes are masked with glowing security blocks to prevent "shoulder surfing" (visual hacking).
- **Circular Vault Interface:** A custom-engineered circular dial for PIN entry, simulating a mechanical bank vault.
- **Autonomous Drone Dispatch:** A real-time delivery tracking simulation featuring "Preparing," "Shipping," and "Delivered" states.
- **Data Persistence:** User credentials (PIN) are stored locally, ensuring a personalized return experience.

## 🧠 UI/UX Problem Solving
During development, I transitioned from a standard grid layout to a circular dial. This decision was made to:
1.  Align closer to the "Vault" creative requirement.
2.  Provide a unique, memorable interaction that stands out from typical marketplace apps.
3.  Demonstrate "outside-the-box" thinking as requested in the candidate brief.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/TSHEGOFATSOMOHLALA/chowhub-vault.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Launch the terminal: `npm run dev`
